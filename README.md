# MyReads Project
- MyReads Project is a bookshelf app, built with ReactJS. 
- It allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. 


# App Functionality
- The ReadsPage displays three shelves.

1. Currently reading
2. Want to read
3. Read 

- Every book has a drop-down list of shelves, which allows you to select and move your book. 
- The SearchPage allows you to search books by name or author.

## Installation Instructions
* clone my repo `https://github.com/mavisluan/my-reads.git`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
